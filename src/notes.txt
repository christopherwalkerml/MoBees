// TODO
- DONE - add night vision to rocky bees ONLY (for now)
- DONE - add flower type stone for rocky bees
- DONE - add flower type ores, for ore-specific bees
- DONE - add magic bee sprite for some special bees
- DONE - harmonic bee should have music/jukebox effect (or amethyst chime? might be easier)
- DONE - alveary sun lamp should glow in game when on?
- DONE - alveary mutator should consume some mutation accelerator item (or fluid, canister for base game)
- DONE - alveary frame housing
 - alveary flower box (holds flower item, no need to place them down?) - maybe also gives a boost to pollination, can be a mini game?
   - maybe the flower box increases in fertility as it goes on. mini game is flowers have to be watered every now and again to boost prod.?
   - alveary flower box starts with empty tiles. a flower sprout must go in new spots. once grown, new plots can open up.
     flowers, grass, grain, etc.. will sprout around 'boosting' flowers automatically from bees.
   - ONLY 1 PER ALVEARY???? if possible... pls or its too OP
   - flowers need to be watered during growth, and when fully grown, but way less.
   - GUI
    - plots become available as flower box ages. player will dig hole, plant flower.
    - different flowers have different abilities? faster pop. growth, better prod., longer life, etc.
    - players can dig out and relocate grown flowers?
 - alveary brood box. must be at bottom of hive. adjacent to flower box.
- make a check within isAlwaysActive for the sun lamp to only work at night.
- make a night light too, for the opposite effect

add excited bee lightning effect
refinery for bee ore produce? bit silly to combine bits into a whole ingot directly
