// TODO
- DONE - add night vision to rocky bees ONLY (for now)
- DONE - add flower type stone for rocky bees
- DONE - add flower type ores, for ore-specific bees
- DONE - add magic bee sprite for some special bees
- DONE - harmonic bee should have music/jukebox effect (or amethyst chime? might be easier)
- DONE - alveary sun lamp should glow in game when on?
- DONE - alveary mutator should consume some mutation accelerator item (or fluid, canister for base game)
- DONE - alveary frame housing
 - alveary flower box (holds flower item, no need to place them down?) - maybe also gives a boost to pollination, can be a mini game?
   - maybe the flower box increases in fertility as it goes on. mini game is flowers have to be watered every now and again to boost prod.?
   - alveary flower box starts with 7 tiles. a proper flower must go in the center spot, then 'boosting' flowers will automatically
     sprout around it.. but only if theyre adjacent to a proper flower. tiles will open adjacent to sprouted flowers.
     The user will have to place flowers in empty tiles, it wont be the most efficient always
- make a check within isAlwaysActive for the sun lamp to only work at night.
- make a night light too, for the opposite effect

add excited bee lightning effect
refinery for bee ore produce? bit silly to combine bits into a whole ingot directly
